# catbot

Catbot 9000 is designed to be a light-hearted entry-level project in writing a function and using basic JavaScript to create an interactive website. 

In this project, I was able to write a function and assign it to a button with an on-click action to cycle through an array of quotes that printed to a text area. 

Comments, suggestions, and feedback are extremely welcome. Thank you for your time!
